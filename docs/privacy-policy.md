## Privacy Policy

1. Permissions  
  Our app doesn't need any permissions.

2. Sharing Data  
  Our app accesses your documents (device folders and files) through the folder picker (using Windows feature) and file picker (using App-specific feature), but never sends your personal information to the outside.

3. Storing Data  
  Our app accesses your documents (device folders and files) through the folder picker (using Windows feature) and file picker (using App-specific feature), and stores the last opened folder in the app. This data will only be used to open the last opened folder the next time you launch the app.
